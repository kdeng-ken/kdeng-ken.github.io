Abstract
------

We study a model in which consumers learn from financial markets. Consumer learning creates a feedback effect; speculators trade on information about firm profitability, while consumers - who drive profitability - react to market information. The firm's pricing decision determines how informative the market becomes: high prices attract only high-valuation consumers, making speculator information about consumer valuations profitable; low prices induce all consumers to purchase, eliminating uncertainty and making speculator information worthless. Financial markets increase expected firm profits and can incentivize higher product quality. However, consumers may not benefit from financial market information, as it enables firms to extract consumer surplus.
